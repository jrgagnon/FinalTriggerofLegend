GOAL
Make a game that doesn't limit the things you use by allowing all items to be used at any time
makes the game free to be played the way the player wants

Dungeons:
- Layed out like original Legend of Zelda
	- Move from room to room
	- Find keys
	- Collect items
	- Solve Puzzles
	- Encounter a boss to complete the dungeons
		- Doing so will reward you with a unique items
		- Possibly a party member who was captured by them
- Conatin Unique Items that will be useful later but not needed
	- May just be unique weapons
	- But could include items like in Zelda that allow you to get to unreachable areas
		- This would allow for backtracking and longer playtime
- Like Megaman, althoght order independant dungeons, there may be an optimal route
- Some Dungeons contain new party members
	
Diverse Party Members:
- Unique skills on all like FF6
	- Each member is different to allow for unique combinations
- Large Roster of Characters somewhere between FF7 and FF6 (8-14)
- Like Chrono Trigger possibly have combos with certain characters
	
Inventory:
- Weapon and Armor Drops scale
	- To fit with the order independant dungeons
Equipables:
- Weapon: Swords, Guns?, Staves
- Armor:
- Accessory: Rings and Other things
	
Battle System:
- Enemies appear in world
- All Enemies scale
	- So when bactracking you still gain relevant XP
	- To fit with the order independant dungeons
- Walking into them starts battle	
 	In Battle:
	- Your proximity affects what abilitys will connect with which enemies
	- Smart attack selection and setup is key
	
Towns:
- Linear Like in Shovel Knight
- Have NPC Quest Givers
- Shops
	- Shop items level dependant
	- Each shop will have the same items but they scale with level
